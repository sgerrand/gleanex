  List OAuth clients

  List the static OAuth clients that admins created for this workspace, ordered by display_name and then by client_id. Dynamically registered clients and Glean's own clients, such as Glean Desktop, are not listed. A client is active when it is enabled. Inactive clients are left out unless an is_active filter includes the value "false". To set a usage limit for a client, send its ai_gateway.usage_client_id, not its client_id, to the usage APIs. The caller needs admin read or billing read permission.

  ## Options

    * `page_size`: Maximum number of clients to return. Defaults to 50. Maximum is 100.
    * `cursor`: Opaque pagination cursor from a previous response. Send the same filters that the previous request used.
      
    * `filters`: JSON-encoded filters that choose which clients are returned. The only supported field is is_active, with the values "true" and "false" and the operator EQUALS. Multiple values OR within a filter. Multiple filters AND together. Without an is_active filter, only active clients are returned. To return active and inactive clients, send [{"field":"is_active","values":["true","false"]}].
